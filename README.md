#UoB MSC Robotics Math_Assignment 2020-2021
For this assignment Gradient Descent Algorithms are written on the pycharm compiler from scratch,and it has not been tested on other compilers.
Each gradient descent version can be accessed from the file saved under its name.
Which variable is used for what purpose is added as an explanation next to the code.
.csv files should be in the same folder with .py files or the code must be updated.
If the results are to be displayed before the iterations are made from the beginning, the initial values of m and c should be replaced with the ones in the form of comments and the iteration value should be reduced.
Algorithm performances were measured with rsquare and RMSE.
In addition, the calculation time is also printed on the console and the graph of the cost function given as output.
Please make sure all required library (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib) is installed before running the code.
After the assignment is evaluated, the report created with the outputs of the algorithms will be published here.
Thank You
